 I am Ankit Khand currently doing a degree in BSc.Computing. I am in my first year.
 So, the subjects here are totally new for me. One of the subjects that I have 
 to study is web development.


 First of all, I am totally new to the web development course.
 Here, I am going to discuss my experience of learning this particular subject. 
 To be honest, I had no idea what software do people use to make a simple website. 
 After joining the college, I found out that software like visual code and sublime text helps in making the website. 
 Moreover, I had joined college late, and during the class, I was not aware of anything that had been taught.
 I was a bit nervous.When I was in the class, I could not even understand a single thing.
 So, with the help of the internet, I learned the basic structure of Html. 
 I was excited and motivated at the same time. 
 I practiced everything from the scratch. While practicing, I encountered many simple errors like missing the closing tag.
 I was glad when I could sort out the problems.
 For inserting the images, I made a mistake several times. I used to miss the type of images like .jpg or .png while inserting the images.


Taking everything into consideration, I would say it was fun learning the basics of Html. 
I am still beginner and I am still learning web development.
I hope someday I will make the worth learning of the web development.<hr></h2>

  I learned the basic structure of web page through this module. I was clueless about this topic but now 
  I have gained some insights about it.Teachers were also co-operative to guide me through the process.
  For choosing the design, I had no clue what to choose 
  so, I randomly picked up the design which I saw fit.
